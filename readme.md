# SociAlert
This is my submission for the SafeTrek JDP. This is an iOS application that uses the [SafeTrek API](http://developers.safetrek.io) to create/cancel alarms when users feel they are in danger. Additionally, users may optionally login with Facebook, in which case a descriptive status update will automatically be posted to their account upon issuing or deleting an alarm.

Notes:
* API keys haven't been included this repo for security
* Deploying app would require undergoing login review from facebook, due to the use of publish permissions (for posting status updates without share dialog)
